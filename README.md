# Odin Recipes

This project is part of the Foundations course in The Odin Project curriculum.

It is a simple website that will contain recipes written in basic HTML.  
Through this project, I will demonstrate skills in:

- Using Git and GitHub effectively (including SSH setup)
- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring a basic project
- Committing code with clear messages

This is a foundational step toward becoming a full stack web developer.
